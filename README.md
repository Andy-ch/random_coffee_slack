# random_coffee_slack

## description
The Random Coffee Bot (RCB) is a weekly virtual networking event that aims to connect members of your Slack community through casual, informal coffee meetings.

Each week, the bot will randomly select two participants and send them a direct message with information on how to make a call for a virtual coffee meeting. These meetings provide an opportunity for participants to get to know each other, exchange ideas, and form new connections.

I hope that this project will help to foster a sense of community among our members and encourage meaningful interactions. I encourage everyone to join in and look forward to having virtual coffee with you!
